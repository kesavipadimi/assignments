       q1.  What is the value of clothes[0] and why?
               const clothes = ['jacket', 't-shirt'];
               clothes.length = 0;
               console.log(clothes[0]);
			  
			  
		output:undefined 
   the length property set to zero here in that case if length is zero all the elements in the array
   are deleted  so after deleting we can find that our array is empty hence we cant find any value over it so 
   it is undefined!
     
	 
	 
	 q2.Write a Javascript program to find the sum of all elements of a given array?
	 
	 
	 
	        var arr =[2,4,6,8,10];
            var sum=0;
            for(var i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            sum=sum+arr[i];
             }
         console.log("sum is :" +sum)
